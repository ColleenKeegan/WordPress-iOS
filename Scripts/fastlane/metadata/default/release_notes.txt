What’s new in the latest release?

The block editor:

– When working with blocks, you may notice a few changes. You can now move blocks up and down your post or page by long-pressing on the “up” and “down” buttons. We’ve also added support for full-width and wide alignment in the Columns block and have made it easier to pick and set a URL for an image in the Image block.

– Do you use P2 to collaborate with your team? When publishing a new post, type the + character to tag another P2 and “cross-post” to the site, alerting its users of your new post.

Various fixes and updates:

– The Choose a Domain feature now returns more options in search results. Try it out!

– In your Site Pages list, you can quickly duplicate a page, which can save you time when creating content.

– Other updates, including changes in the Reader, improve your overall app experience.
